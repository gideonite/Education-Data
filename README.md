# education-data

Two parts:
1.  Clojure code (hesitant to call it a library) for munging data formats from
    https://nycopendata.socrata.com/.
2.  Data visualization of this munged data.

## Usage

Not done yet.  Tentatively, `cd` into web and fire up your favorite trivial
server.  Mine is `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
